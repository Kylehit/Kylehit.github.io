Thus, A could be adjusted to control the TE10 freq. \n\n- Characteristic impedance Z0\n\n  For TEM wave, Z0 is freq. independent. **Thus Z0 could be controlled by the ratio between 2H and W.**\n\n### Example\n\nUnimodal operation at 4GHz\n\n\n\n### Reference\n\n[1] F.

It could be seen that the the E field terminates at the transverse wall. Due to the gaps between metal vias, the field will leaked outside the SIW. \n\n![](.\\pic\\TM_RectWG.PNG)\n\nThe estimation for the effective width of SIW is\n$$\nw_{eff} = w-\\frac{d^2}{0.95s}\n$$\nwhere d is the diameter of the metal vias, w represents their transverse spacing and the s ithe longitudinal spacing ( shown in the following figure)\n\n![](.\\pic\\Geometry_SIW.PNG)\n\n(2) could be refined in many relations.\n\n#### 2.2 Loss mechanisms\n\nloss is critical when SIW works at millimeter wave freqs.\n\nThree loss sources:\n\n- conductor loss ---> finite condutivity of the metal walls\n- dieletric loss --> lossy dielectric material\n- possibly radiation loss  --> energy leakage through the gaps\n\nSolutions:\n\n- For condutor loss: increase substrate thickness (attenuation constant proportional to the inverse of substrate thickness)\n- Dielectric loss: use better material. dimesion changes won't help\n- Radiation loss: **radiation losses can be kept reasonably small if s/d<2.5, with s/d= 2 being the recommended value. **\n\nInsertion loss could be significantly increased by the effect of surface roughness in condutors.\n\n\n\nLoss comparison between SIW, Microstrip, CPW: generally comparable losses compared to traditional planar transmission lines.\n\n#### 2.4 Size and bandwidth\n\nwidth of SIW--> cutoff freq of fundamental mode\n\noperation bandwidth --> one octave ( from cutoff freq f1 of TE10 TO cutoff freq f2 of TE20 mode\n\n![](.\\pic\\new SIW_type.PNG)\n\n- SIFWL: reduce size by more than 2, slightly larger losses\n- HMSIW: \n- SISW: improve bandwidth, 7.5 - 18GHz (with 40% bandwidth enhancement)\n- Ridge SIW: the ridge was implemented through a row of thin, partial-height metal posts located in the centre of the longer side of the waveguide. 4.9 - 13.39 GHz, with 73% bandwidth enhancement. There is a lot has been done to further improve the bandwidth. ...\n\n### 3 SIW passive circuits\n\n#### 3.1 Filters and couplers\n\n**inductive post**:\n\nMetal post(柱) or screw（螺钉） extending across a waveguide parallel to the *E* field, to add *inductive susceptance* in parallel with the waveguide for tuning or matching purposes. \n\n![](.\\pic\\WG_Impedance_Matching.PNG)\n\nReference:  https://www.radartutorial.eu/03.linetheory/tl16.en.html \n\n**iris**:\n\ndiaphragm consisting of thin overlapping plates that can be adjusted to change the diameter of a central opening.\n\n#### 3.2 Transitions\n\n### 4 SIW active circuits\n\nOscillators, Mixers, Amplifiers\n\n### 5 SIW antennas\n\n- SIW slotted antenna [1]\n\n- leaky-wave antennas \n\n  - longitudinal spacing leakage [2]\n  - Based on TE20 mode[3]\n\n- Modified Vivaldi radiator [4]\n\n- Cavity-backed SIW antennas \n\n  - slotted SIW cavity fed by a CPW[5]\n\n  - slotted SIW cavity with meander line and fed by a MS line[6]\n\n  - Ku-band xxx, 2 by 2 array of metal patches[7]\n\n    ![](.\\pic\\Mohamed.A_2009_cavity_backed_2_by_2_array.PNG)\n\n    ![](.\\pic\\Mohamed.A_2009_cavity_backed_2_by_2_array_fabricated.PNG)\n\n- H-plane sectoral horn antenna, with dieletric loading, high gain and narrow beamwidths [8]\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Yan, L., Hong, W., Hua, G., Chen, J., Wu, K., Cui, T.J.: ‘Simulation and experiment on SIW slot array antennas’, IEEE Microw.
